          The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans
          and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In
          mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the
          backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the
          respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and
          transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from
          the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange.
          Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different
          species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to
          support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into
          the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism
          still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration
          that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow
          that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.
