          The human body is the structure of a human being. It is composed of
          many different types of cells that together create tissues and
          subsequently organ systems. They ensure homeostasis and the viability
          of the human body.

          Organs, structured collections of cells with a specific function,
          mostly sit within the body, with the exception of skin. Examples
          include the heart, lungs and liver. Many organs reside within cavities
          within the body. These cavities include the abdomen (which contains
          the stomach, for example) and pleura, which contains the lungs.
