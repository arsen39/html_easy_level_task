          The heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood
          through the blood vessels of the circulatory system.[1] The pumped
          blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying
          metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs.[2] In humans, the
          heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located
          between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.
